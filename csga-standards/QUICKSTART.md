#### 5. Get Training Recommendations

```
User: I want to become a Security Analyst. What training should I take?

Tool: csga_training_pathway
Arguments: {
  "current_level": "Intermediate",
  "goal": "Security_Analyst",
  "sector": "Finance",
  "budget_usd": 15000
}
```

Returns recommended courses, certifications, timeline, and cost estimates.

#### 6. Check Compliance Status

```
User: Are we compliant with NIST and ISO 27001?

Tool: csga_compliance_check
Arguments: {
  "organization_type": "Technology",
  "size": "Enterprise",
  "current_controls": [
    "Firewall",
    "SIEM",
    "MFA",
    "Encryption",
    "EDR",
    "Access Control"
  ],
  "geographic_scope": ["USA", "Europe"]
}
```

Returns compliance status for all applicable frameworks, gaps, and priority remediation actions.

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start

1. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (need 18+)
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Check for errors in console output

### Tools not showing up

1. Ensure server is running: `npm start`
2. Verify MCP client configuration points to correct path
3. Check that `dist/index.ts` exists (run `npm run build`)

### Invalid input errors

1. Check that arguments match the tool's schema
2. Verify all required fields are provided
3. Review README.md for example tool usage
