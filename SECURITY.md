## Security Best Practices

When using MEOK AI MCP servers:

1. **Keep packages updated** — Regularly update to the latest versions
2. **Review permissions** — Understand what each MCP server can access
3. **Use environment variables** — Never hardcode API keys or secrets
4. **Monitor logs** — Watch for unusual activity
5. **Follow principle of least privilege** — Only grant necessary permissions
6. **Enable audit logging** — Track all MCP server interactions
7. **Use encrypted connections** — TLS 1.3 for all communications

## Scope

This security policy covers:

- All 67 MEOK AI MCP servers
- The MEOK AI Labs platform (meok-global.vercel.app)
- API endpoints and webhook integrations
- Stripe payment integration
