## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Assessing a Healthcare AI System

1. Start with risk assessment:
```
risk_assessment(
  system_name="DiagnosticAI",
  system_description="ML system for pathology slide analysis",
  scope_and_impact="Used in 20 hospital labs for cancer diagnosis, 10,000+ patients/year"
)
```
Result: High risk → EU AI Act compliance required

2. Check sector-specific requirements:
```
sector_compliance(
  sector="healthcare",
  system_description="Pathology analysis AI..."
)
```
Result: HIPAA, FDA, clinical validation requirements

3. Run CASA assessment:
```
casa_assessment(
  system_name="DiagnosticAI",
  system_description="Pathology analysis AI...",
  deployment_context="Hospital diagnostic labs in EU and US"
)
```
Result: Tier 2-3 recommended (third-party audit + continuous monitoring)

4. Review relevant frameworks:
```
crosswalk_lookup(crosswalk_id="CW-19")  # ISO/IEC 23894
crosswalk_lookup(crosswalk_id="CW-02")  # ISO/IEC 42001
```

### Example 2: Evaluating LLM Safety

1. Risk classification:
```
risk_assessment(
  system_name="CompanyLLM",
  system_description="Large language model for customer service...",
  scope_and_impact="Used to respond to 100,000 customer queries daily"
)
```

2. Check multiple security frameworks:
```
crosswalk_lookup(crosswalk_id="CW-25")  # OWASP LLM Top 10
crosswalk_lookup(crosswalk_id="CW-22")  # OWASP MCP Top 10
crosswalk_lookup(crosswalk_id="CW-23")  # OWASP Agentic AI Top 10
```

3. CASA assessment:
```
casa_assessment(
  system_name="CompanyLLM",
  system_description="LLM for customer service...",
  deployment_context="Production customer-facing service"
)
```

### Example 3: Incident Response

1. Generate response protocol:
```
incident_response(
  incident_name="LLM Generated Offensive Content",
  incident_description="System generated offensive content about protected group...",
  severity_assessment="High"
)
```

2. Reference Charter principles:
```
charter_lookup(article_number=9)   # Fairness and non-discrimination
charter_lookup(article_number=14)  # Incident reporting and response
```

3. Re-assess after remediation:
```
casa_assessment(
  system_name="CompanyLLM",
  system_description="LLM with improved content filtering...",
  deployment_context="Production with enhanced safety measures"
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Assessment Workflow

Always follow this sequence for comprehensive analysis:
1. Risk assessment (understand the risk level)
2. Sector compliance (check industry-specific requirements)
3. CASA assessment (determine certification pathway)
4. Crosswalk lookup (map to specific frameworks)
5. Charter review (implement governance principles)

### 2. Documentation

Keep detailed documentation of:
- Assessment results and reasoning
- Compliance gaps identified
- Remediation plans with timelines
- Evidence of compliance measures
- Monitoring and audit results

### 3. Continuous Monitoring

For Tier 3-4 systems:
- Establish continuous monitoring dashboards
- Set up automated alerts for performance degradation
- Schedule regular compliance reviews
- Document and respond to any deviations

### 4. Incident Management

When incidents occur:
- Use incident_response tool immediately
- Follow recommended notification requirements
- Document all investigation findings
- Implement preventive measures
- Re-assess system risk after resolution

## Integration Examples

### With Python/LangChain

```python
from mcp import McpClient

client = McpClient("csoai-governance")

# Run CASA assessment
result = client.call_tool("casa_assessment", {
    "system_name": "MyAISystem",
    "system_description": "...",
    "deployment_context": "..."
})
```

### With JavaScript/Node.js

```javascript
const { McpClient } = require("@modelcontextprotocol/sdk");

const client = new McpClient("csoai-governance");

const result = await client.callTool("risk_assessment", {
  system_name: "MyAISystem",
  system_description: "...",
  scope_and_impact: "..."
});
```
