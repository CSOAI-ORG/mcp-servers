2. Update `SECTOR_THREAT_MAPPING` for sector-specific lookup
3. Include MITRE ATT&CK mapping

### Adding New Training Paths

1. Add courses to `TRAINING_COURSES` in `src/training.ts`
2. Define training pathway in `TRAINING_PATHWAYS`
3. Add certifications to `CERTIFICATIONS` database

### Adding New Compliance Frameworks

1. Add framework to `COMPLIANCE_DATABASE` in `src/compliance.ts`
2. Update `applicableMap` in `getApplicableFrameworks()`
3. Define gaps and priority actions

## Error Handling

The server implements comprehensive error handling:
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- Try-catch blocks around tool execution
- Descriptive error messages
- Graceful degradation for missing data

---

## Performance Considerations

- In-memory database for instant lookups
- O(1) direct lookups for specific standards
- O(n) search for query-based lookups (optimized for small datasets)
- Lazy evaluation of compliance calculations
- Minimal external dependencies

---

## Testing

The server is built with production-grade code quality:
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No unused variables or parameters
- Comprehensive type coverage
- Zod runtime validation on all inputs

---

## Security Considerations

- No external API calls (all data self-contained)
- No credential storage
- No sensitive data in responses
- Suitable for air-gapped environments
- HIPAA-compatible recommendations (no actual health data)
