## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install @csoai/healthcare-ai-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "healthcare-ai": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@csoai/healthcare-ai-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage Example

Run a complete healthcare AI governance assessment:

1. **HIPAA Assessment** — Understand PHI protection requirements
   ```
   hipaa_ai_assessment(
     system_name: "Diagnostic AI System",
     system_description: "ML model for cancer diagnosis using medical imaging",
     phi_data_types: "diagnostic images, patient demographics, treatment history",
     deployment_environment: "cloud"
   )
   ```

2. **FDA Assessment** — Determine regulatory pathway
   ```
   fda_ai_assessment(
     system_name: "Cancer Detection SaMD",
     intended_use: "assist radiologists in detecting lung cancer from CT scans",
     clinical_context: "diagnosis and treatment decision support",
     ai_model_type: "deep learning convolutional neural network"
   )
   ```

3. **Clinical Safety Assessment** — Evaluate safety and bias risks
   ```
   clinical_ai_safety(
     system_name: "Cancer Detection AI",
     clinical_domain: "radiology and oncology",
     patient_population: "adult patients with suspected lung cancer",
     decision_autonomy: "decision support - clinician makes final determination"
   )
   ```

4. **EU MDR Compliance** — EU market access requirements
   ```
   eu_mdr_compliance(
     system_name: "Cancer Detection Device",
     device_description: "AI software analyzing CT images using deep learning",
     intended_purpose: "diagnosis of lung cancer",
     risk_class: "Class IIb"
   )
   ```

## Regulatory Frameworks Covered

- **HIPAA** — 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164 (Privacy, Security, Breach Notification)
- **FDA AI/ML** — Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) classification and regulatory pathways
- **EU MDR** — Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 (CE marking, conformity assessment)
- **EU AI Act** — High-risk AI system requirements for healthcare
