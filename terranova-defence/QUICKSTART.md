## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
```bash
# Check Node.js version (need 18+)
node --version

# Clean rebuild
rm -rf build node_modules
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Tool errors
- Verify all required input parameters are provided
- Check parameter types match schema (strings, arrays, enums)
- Review error message for schema validation details

### Slow responses
- Large input arrays may take longer to process
- Complex architectures require more analysis
- This is normal; responses still complete within 5 seconds

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with your systems**: Use MCP client libraries to integrate
2. **Develop custom workflows**: Combine tools for comprehensive assessments
3. **Automate compliance monitoring**: Schedule regular assessments
4. **Build assessment pipeline**: Chain tools for end-to-end analysis
5. **Integrate threat intelligence**: Enhance APT assessments with live feeds
